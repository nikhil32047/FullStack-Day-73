Day 73:
===========

For your Full Stack Series, understanding Objects is a massive milestone. 
In JavaScript, objects are the building blocks of almost everything. They allow you to store collections of data as key-value pairs.Here are the notes for the three primary ways to create objects:📦 JavaScript Objects: 

3 Ways to Create Them
============================

1. Using an Object Literal
=================================
This is the most common, simplest, and "syntactic sugar" way to create an object. You define the properties and values inside curly braces {}.Best for: Static data or single instances.Syntax: let obj = { key: value };💻 Example:JavaScriptconst car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    start: function() {
        console.log("Engine started!");
    }
};

console.log(car.brand); // Output: Toyota

2. Using an Instance of an Object (new Object())
======================================================
This uses the Object constructor provided by JavaScript. You create an empty object first and then attach properties to it.Best for: When you want to dynamically build an object based on conditions.Syntax: let obj = new Object();💻 Example:JavaScriptconst user = new Object();

user.id = 101;
user.name = "Rahul";
user.isAdmin = true;

console.log(user.name); // Output: Rahul

3. Using an Object Constructor Function
=============================================
This is a "blueprint" approach. You define a function that describes the structure, and then use the new keyword to create multiple unique instances.Best for: Creating multiple objects of the same "type" (like multiple users or products).Syntax: Uses a function with the this keyword.💻 Example:JavaScriptfunction BankAccount(customer, balance) {
    this.customer = customer;
    this.balance = balance;
    this.deposit = function(amount) {
        this.balance += amount;
    };
}

// Creating multiple instances (objects) from the same constructor
const account1 = new BankAccount("Amit", 5000);
const account2 = new BankAccount("Sonal", 12000);

console.log(account1.customer); // Output: Amit
console.log(account2.balance);  // Output: 12000
